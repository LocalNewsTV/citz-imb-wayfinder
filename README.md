Citizen Services Capstone Project Team B (Wayfinder)

# Executive Summary
## Project Information
[![Lifecycle:Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Experimental-339999)](<Redirect-URL>)
## Project Description
The "Wayfinder" application is an attempted solution to third-party applications directing citizens and employees to government services. While the parties involved (google, openmapstracker, etc) take due care to ensure accuracy, they can never attain the same level of trust as the government itself telling you to go to these locations. Thus, for maximum trust, the end user should use a governmentally certified application to direct them to government services, whether that be a citizen looking for the nearest "Service Canada" location, or an employee looking for the nearest available office. In addition, the analytics that shall be provided by the application will serve to further refine government knowledge about what services users are looking for, where those services are located, and how far the end-user must travel to reach them. This knowledge will better equip the government to adjust where/how services are provided, to better serve its citizens.
